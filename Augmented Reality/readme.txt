-- Operating System: MacOS IDE: XCode

-- Instructions for executables have been mentioned in the .cpp files

-- Extensions are a part of other functions thus could not be mentioned separately in the header or main files. I have pursued the following extensions:

1. Virtual object insertion on multiple targets in a scene
2. Virtual object insertion in static images, pre-captures video sequences
3. Change target to something else
4. Insert video onto target area
5. Tested calibration and quality on webcam and mobile camera
