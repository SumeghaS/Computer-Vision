-- Project Description: 
We chose to spend the time we had diving into the world of machine generated art and read up as much as we could about Generative Adversarial Networks and implemented various kinds of the same. We were also able to achieve decent results for converting images to Monet paintings which we hope you enjoy as much as we did. 

-- The project contains the following folders:
	-- Scripts: Contains all the python scripts corresponding to the projects. 
		-- fashionmnist_gan.py: DCGAN to generate grayscale images
		-- coloured_fashionmnist_gan.py: DCGAN to generate coloured images
		-- anime_gan.py: WGAN to generate anime faces
		-- monet_cycleGAN.py: CycleGAN to render images to monet paintings
	-- Report: Contains the pdf for the final report
	-- Generated Monet Paintings: Contains 8 sample image to converted paintings
